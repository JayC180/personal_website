## Summary
I am currently a computer science major with a focus on security. Outside of computers, I'm passionate about music and philosophy.

### Computer Science
I like security, systems and networks. My interest in security comes from the creativity of vulnerability research and exploits. I am currently focusing on reverse engineering, using tools like Ghidra and x64dbg. In terms of programming, I am most familiar with C and Python.

### Music
Music has always been my greatest passion. I mostly listen to progressive metal, jazz fusion, and math rock. If you know anything about these genres, you can tell that I'm pretty nerdy. Some of my favorite bands include Animals as Leaders, Car Bomb, and Mirar. I study extensivly in rhythm theories, and might post some of my own ideas here.

### Philosophy
I also study continental philosophy. I am a Hegelian who is into Lacanian psychoanalysis. Some of the other philosophers that I have read:
- Schelling
- Heidegger
- Kierkegaard
- Satre
- Merleau-Ponty
- Husserl 
- Derrida
- Deleuze
