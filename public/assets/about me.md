## Summary
I am currently a computer science major with a focus on security. Outside of coding, I'm passionate about music and philosophy.

### Computer Science
I like low-level systems and networks. My interest in security comes from the creativity of vulnerability research and exploits. I am currently focusing on reverse engineering, using tools like Ghidra, GDB, and x64dbg. In terms of programming, I am most familiar with C and Python.

### Music
Music has always been my greatest passion. I mostly listen to progressive metal, jazz fusion, and math rock. If you know about these genres, you can already tell that I'm pretty nerdy. Some of my favorite bands include Animals as Leaders and Car Bomb. I study rhythm theories extensivly, and will probably post some of my own ideas in the website.

### Philosophy
I study continental philosophy and consider myself a Hegelian. I am also into Lacanian psychoanalysis. Some of the other philosophers that I have read include:
- Schelling
- Heidegger
- Kierkegaard
- Satre
- Merleau-Ponty
- Husserl 
- Derrida
- Deleuze
