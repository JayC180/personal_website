## Summary
I am a CS major whose main interest is in security. Besides CS, I am also into music and philosophy.

### Computer Science
I like low-level stuff, especially systems and networks. I got into security because I see creativity in vulnerability researches and exploits. I am currently focusing on reverse engineering, mainly using Ghidra, GDB, and x64dbg. In terms of programming languages, I am most familiar with C and Python.

### Music
Music has always been my greatest passion. I mostly listen to progressive metal, jazz fusion, and math rock. If you know anything about these genres, you can already tell that I'm pretty nerdy. Some of my favorite bands include Animals as Leaders and Car Bomb. I study and think extensivly in rhythm theories, and will probably post some of my own ideas in the website.

### Philosophy
I study continental philosophy and self-claim to be a Hegelian. I am also into Lacanian psychoanalysis. Some of the other philosophers that I have read:
- Schelling
- Heidegger
- Kierkegaard
- Satre
- Merleau-Ponty
- Husserl 
- Derrida
- Deleuze
