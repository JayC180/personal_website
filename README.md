# About
This is my personal website, made with React. This website aims to emulate a desktop environment, not a complete OS. I will keep adding features occasionally.

Desktop environment is something that I have always wanted to make. This website will be static and mainly used for me to post blogs/interests. 

### Todo
- [ ] Organize blogs and stuff
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Maybe a login screen?
- [ ] Add more stuff into terminal
- [ ] Make a prettier alert
- [ ] Find more and prettier icons
- [ ] Actually implement symbolic link in the file system
- [ ] Syntax highlighting in the terminal
