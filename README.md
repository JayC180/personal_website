# About
This is my personal website, made with React. This website aims to emulate a desktop environment, not a complete OS. I will keep adding features occasionally.

A website that emulates a desktop environment is something that I have always wanted to make. This website will be static and mainly used for me to post blogs/interests. Not made to be compatible with mobile.
